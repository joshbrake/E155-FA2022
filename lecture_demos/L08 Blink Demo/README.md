# Lecture 8 Blink Demo

Example C code to blink the on-board LED on the STM32L432KC.
There are three main examples.
1. Basic blink with direct pointer manipulation of the appropriate registers.
2. Register manipulation via pointers and a structure typedef
3. Development of a basic GPIO device driver (driver and header file)
