# ARM Assembly Filter Demo

This assembly file contains a demonstration of how to code a simple running average filter in ARM assembly.

The code contains two main sections
1. Allocation and labeling of memory locations for test array
2. Main function with loops to load the input data, perform the computation, and store the results.
